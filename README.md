# Stack Overflow-Driven Power BI Dashboard

This repository contains everything you need to create a Power BI dashboard powered by the Stack Overflow API, using an Automation Job, a dataset, and a Node.js application.

**Power BI** is an interactive data visualization platform by Microsoft. While Stack Overflow offers a RESTful JSON API, Power BI doesnâ€™t natively support direct API connections. To bridge this gap, we'll use an **Automation Job** to pull data from the Stack Overflow API into a database, and then build the Power BI dashboard on top of that dataset.

> ðŸ“– **Step-by-step instructions for connecting your Stack Overflow instance to Power BI are available in the following Support articles:**

## ðŸš€ Quick Summary (TL;DR)

Youâ€™ll set up a cron expression in a Node.js application to periodically pull data from the Stack Overflow API and push it to your data source. This is handled by an **Automation Job** executing the script on a schedule.
